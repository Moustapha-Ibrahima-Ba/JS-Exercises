# JS-Exercises
This is a repository where I will put lot of exercises. The plan is to, maybe, turn it into an open source repository.

## Outline

- [diceRolling](./js/diceRolling.js)
- [fibonacci](./js/fibonacci.js)
- [LeapYear](./js/leapYear.js)
- [nbEvenOdd](./js/nbEvenOdd.js)
- [product](./js/product.js)
- [sequenceOfSquares](./js/sequenceOfSquares.js)

## Description

- ### [diceRolling](./js/diceRolling.js) 
contains two functions that returns you the sum of the numbers you get when you roll the dice.
- #### **launch2( )**: 
    It allows you to simulate a rolling Twice.
- #### **launchN(numberOfRolling)**: 
    It allows you to simulate **N** Rollings. **N** is an integer choses by the user. (example: launchN(**3**))
- ### [fibonacci](./js/fibonacci.js)
This is a code for the Fibonacci. 
- ### [LeapYear](./js/leapYear.js)( )
is a function that allows you to check whether a number is leap or not.
- ### [nbEvenOdd](./js/nbEvenOdd.js)( )
Is a function that returns the number of even and odd element(s) in the array received as argument.
- ### [product](./js/product.js)( )
Is a function that calculates and returns the product n1∗(n1+1)∗...∗n2(1≤n1≤ n2) of the integers between n1 and n2 inclusive.
- ### [randomSentence](./js/randomSentence.js)( )
A function to create sentence from an array of words
- ### [sequenceOfSquares](./js/sequenceOfSquares.js)( )
Is a function that displays the sequence of squares up to **N<sup>2</sup>** where **N** is an integer chosen by the user. The display will be in the form: 0 − 1 − 4 − 9 − 16 − 25 − 36 − 49 − 64 − 81 − 100...<br>
In the following example the integer N is equal to **4**: 0 − 1 − 4 − 9 − 16.
<br>
it returns all the square until **4<sup>2</sup>**

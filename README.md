# JS-Exercises
This is a repository where I will put lot of exercises. The plan is to, maybe, turn it into an open source repository.

## Outline

- [LeapYear](./js/leapYear.js)
- [diceRolling](./js/diceRolling.js)

## Description
- [LeapYear](./js/leapYear.js) is a funtion that allows you to check whether a number is leap or not.
- [diceRolling](./js/diceRolling.js) contains two functions that returns you the sum of the numbers you get when you roll the dice
    - **launch2()** allows you to simulate a rolling Twice.
    - **launchN(numberOfRolling)** allows you to simulate **N** Rollings.
